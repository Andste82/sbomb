# Deviations

Deviations from `sbomb-spec-v3.1.md`, recorded per specification section 0.2.
Each entry states what the specification assumes, what was observed, and what
the implementation does instead.

## D1 — Linker dependency files do not enumerate archive members

Section 11.3 treats the linker dependency file (`--dependency-file`) as the
highest-fidelity link evidence, listing "every file the link consumed,
including extracted archive members".

GNU ld 2.42 does not do this. For the `p02-static` fixture it records the
archive but not the extracted member:

```
app.d     libcrypto.a
app.map   libcrypto.a(crypto.c.o)   CMakeFiles/app.dir/main.c.o (aes_round)
```

Member-level attribution is available only from the linker map. The map
parsers are therefore a **required** evidence source for GNU ld, not the
fallback that section 11.2 places at priority 3. The dependency file remains
authoritative for the set of link inputs; the map supplies member granularity.

Consequence: `MISSING_LINK_EVIDENCE` must not be satisfied by a dependency
file alone when member-level resolution is required, and section 12's
`ARCHIVE_MEMBERS_UNRESOLVED` applies whenever only a dependency file is present.

## D2 — The race detector requires cgo

The universal gate in `docs/milestones/README.md` requires `go test ./... -race`.
The race detector needs cgo, while section 37.1 requires release binaries to
build with `CGO_ENABLED=0`, which is also the devcontainer default.

The gate is therefore run with `CGO_ENABLED=1` in the dedicated `race` CI job.
Release builds continue to use `CGO_ENABLED=0`. Locally the same override
applies: `CGO_ENABLED=1 go test -race ./...`.

## D3 — The CMake File API index filename is not reproducible

CMake names the File API index `index-<configure timestamp>.json`. The
referenced reply files are content-addressed and therefore stable, but the
index filename changes on every configure.

The fixture corpus commits the index under its real name, and consumers must
locate it by glob rather than by a fixed filename -- which is also how a real
build directory behaves.

## D4 — ARM fixtures link freestanding

The devcontainer provides `arm-none-eabi-gcc` without newlib, so the
`arm-none-eabi` fixtures link with `-nostdlib -nostartfiles`. This is closer to
the bare-metal firmware builds the tool primarily targets than a hosted link
would be, so it is kept even where newlib is available.

## D5 — Fixture toolchain directories name a configuration, not a compiler version

Corpus directories are named `gcc-ninja`, `gcc-make`, `clang-ninja`,
`arm-none-eabi` and `mingw-w64`. They identify the build configuration the
adapters care about -- compiler family plus CMake generator -- rather than a
compiler version that silently goes stale when the container is updated. The
exact toolchain version is recorded in each fixture's `manifest.json` and
`PROVENANCE.md`.

## D6 — The CycloneDX schemas are draft-07, not draft 2020-12

Section 32.5 requires validation with "a pure-Go JSON Schema draft 2020-12
validator". The official CycloneDX 1.6 schema files declare
`http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#`, as do the SPDX and JSF schemas they
reference.

The embedded validator therefore has to support draft-07. The one in use
(`github.com/santhosh-tekuri/jsonschema/v6`) supports both, so the requirement
is met in substance: validation is in-process, pure Go, cgo-free and needs no
network. The draft named in the specification is simply not the one CycloneDX
publishes.

## D7 — Grouping components are anchor-derived for now

Section 19.2 lists eight component-mapping strategies. Only the last one --
the anchor root itself -- is implemented, so every used file belongs to exactly
one named component but the names come from anchors rather than from curated
configuration, package-manager metadata or submodule boundaries. The earlier
strategies are roadmap phase 4; until then a component carries no version,
supplier or purl, and `UNKNOWN_VERSION` and `MISSING_SUPPLIER` are not yet
emitted.
